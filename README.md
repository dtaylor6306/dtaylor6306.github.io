# My React Website

## About the Project:

    I created a website in the style of a professional personal website. I wanted my website to be stylelish so I used and learned many different tools. I learned a great deal, like how to open a link in another tab when clicked to how to place a downloadable pdf into a webpage.
## Tools Used:
![uiGradients](https://uigradients.com/): Used for color schemes

![React-MDL](https://tleunen.github.io/react-mdl/): Used for my menus.

![FontAwesome](fontawesome.com/): Used for the github logo and could be used for many more.
## Pages:
    My pages are: 
    1.Home/Landing
    2.About Me
    3.Resume
    4.Schedule
## Project Requirements:
    I have more than 3 pages.
    I have 5 components.
    I have also done the testing that was required.
    My schedule reads from a JSON file.
